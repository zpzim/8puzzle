# 8puzzle
This is a simple C++ application that solves the 8 sliding tile puzzle using A*.
It can accept a user defined 8-puzzle, 15-puzzle, or 24-puzzle, or randomly generate
a solvable puzzle of one of those sizes.

The application can use the following heuristics:
  1. Uniform Cost Search
  2. Misplaced Tile
  3. Manhattan Distance
